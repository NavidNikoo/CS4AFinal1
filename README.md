Hello!

The Java program represents a basic banking system. It has a Bank class managing customer accounts, a Customer class implementing a SavingsAccount interface, and interactions through a console-based menu. Customers can register personal information, log in credentials, perform transactions such as deposit, withdraw, transfering money between different accounts, and view the last 5 transactions.

The program employs timestamps from the Date class for transaction records, updating balances based on account conditions. Input validations and a password policy enhance security. The system aims to provide basic banking operations and user account management.

Accounts get updated once a month. 1% penalty is placed if the balance is less than $200. Accounts with $10k or more gets a 4% interest rate per month. There is an account limit of $300k when it comes to transfers.
